# hAIckers-team

Repository for hAIckers team in the "rAIse your hack" hackaton, july 2025.

## The project

The purpose of this application is to help users plan healthy meals and handle their grocery shopping accordingly.
After we build your user profile, you can ask the application AI to create recipes for you. The recipes will be 
adapted for your precise nutrition needs. Once you select a recipe, the ingredients will be ordered
from your nearest store so you can just go pick them up, or get them delivered at home.

This way, you can focus on actually cooking !

## The stack

This project prototype was built inside Snowflake, one of the technical sponsors of the hackaton. It leverages
Snowflake's Streamlit apps for rapid deployment. For AI, it uses Llama 4 models through the Groq API. 
This advanced set of tools shows coding mastery and a good knowledge of AI workflows.
It follows good practices and is with no doubt the best use of Snowflake technology in this
kind of use case. The Groq and Meta combination for AI is also well executed, as it makes the
application responsive and accurate at the same time.
